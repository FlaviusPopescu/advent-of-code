# Advent Of Code

Welcome! I started an Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project after [this JetBrains video][sebi-video]
came up in my feed. Thanks, Sebastian and team, for the reminder and encouragement to join in the fun.

Hopefully I'll get a chance to add as many Kotlin solutions to the `aoc-2021` module as possible, while
keeping a few helper modules around (e.g. `input-processing`). I find it helpful to try problems out and
come up with my own solution before reading through others'. Here are [general tips and Q&A][aoc-about].

Hope you have a great winter!

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
