# Advent Of Code

Welcome! I started an Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project after [this video][sebi-video]
came up in my feed. In the video, [Sebastian][sebi-url] from JetBrains walks us through 
what the AOC challenges are like, and it seemed like a great chance to join in the fun 
and try this out in Kotlin. Getting started is even easier with their
[aoc-kotlin-template][template]. Thanks, Sebastian and team, for the timely reminder
that AOC 2021 is on!

It's looking like the Day 01 solution is already going to take advantage of some handy
kotlinlang standard library functions for collections, destructuring declarations, and more.
I'll hopefully get a chance to add as many solutions to the `aoc-2021` project module, but I
will likely keep some helper modules around (e.g. `input-processing`).

And as Sebastian recommended in the video, the goal here is to have fun, keep it low-key, and 
get some good conversations going. Hope you have a great winter!

    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
